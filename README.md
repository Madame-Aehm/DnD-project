Project for **Code Academy Berlin**.

This project is the final part of my first module with Code Academy Berlin. The goal is to become familiar using React Router, Hooks, and Context, as well as implimenting a basic login and document storage functionality with Firebase. I've used an API to create an "explore" menu, which holds information about various aspects of the Dungeons and Dragons tabletop game. If a user creates an account, they can then save items from the explore pages and view them in a favourites list. I've also attempted to create a character build function. The result is a very basic character, built using input from the user and API fetch results. Users can also delete items from their characters or favourites lists, or delete their account and all linked collections entirely.
